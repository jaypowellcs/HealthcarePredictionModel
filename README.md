# Healthcare Prediction Model
## User Guide<br />
Below is a guide of how to use the model. Please follow the steps below.<br />
**1.Download the required software.**<br />
  &emsp;a.	To be able to run the application, you will need to download an application called Anaconda Navigator to be able to run the program. I will put a link below explaining how to download it. Please follow the steps in the link installing the program. <br />
  &emsp;b.	https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/<br />
**2.	After you have downloaded the software, you will need to put two files in a folder on your computer. There are two methods of obtaining the files.**<br />
  &emsp;a.	GitHub – the files are hosted on GitHub, and you can download straight from the link below.<br />
  &emsp;i.	Link to GitHub: https://github.com/jaypowellcs/HealthcarePredictionModel<br />
  &emsp;b.	The files will also be submitted to the client and can be manually downloaded. <br />
**3.	The files needed are:** <br />
   &emsp;a.	HealthCareCostPredictionModel.ipynb<br />
   &emsp;b.	Insurance.csv<br />
**4.	After the files are downloaded and put on a folder on your computer. Open Anaconda Navigator and click on Jupyter notebooks. I have included screenshots of what you need to select.** <br />
   &emsp;a. After opening Anaconda Navigator, you will need to select the Jupyter Notebook option as seen in 4b. <br />

5.	After the file is open, follow the instructions that are included on the top of each command, by pressing shift and enter at the same time.
6.	To make a prediction based on the model, navigate to section 2 of HealthCareCostPredictionModel.ipynb and input the data of the customer that you would like to predict their healthcare costs. I have included an example below in 6a.
